Have you ever imagined a book that has words moving around and expressing their meaning visually via animation?

Here we present a new text editor solution where end-users can write and read animated text contents.
This package is backed by [slate.js](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate)

## Install

```bash
npm install --save vivid-editor
or
yarn add vivid-editor
```

## Quick Start

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import VividEditor from 'vivid'
import 'vivid/dist/index.css'

class Example extends Component {
  render() {
    return <VividEditor />
  }
}
```
